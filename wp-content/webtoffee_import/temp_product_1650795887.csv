The sleek yet compact focus of the Detroit Bunk Bed's design works especially well for smaller bedrooms where space is sparse.

Whatever your ailment, these beds and adjustable mattresses can maneuver into the optimum position for you to get a comfortable night’s sleep. Sleeping on a slight incline with the knees elevated supports the natural curve of the spine, relieving pressure points and keeping the muscles relaxed. Life in later years can also be improved with adjustable beds for the elderly. As time goes on, our muscles can become stiff or weak and many people struggle to get out of bed. An adjustable bed can bring you to a sitting up position, so you can easily swing your legs off the side of the bed without having to pull yourself up.</p>\nThis product is a mobility product and can be <strong>VAT exempt</strong> if the purchaser can declare they are chronically sick or disabled.\n\nSome of the wider bed bases that fit two people have the bed split into two separate mattresses (Kingsize &amp; Superking). This allows you to control one side independent of the other. So, if you have a partner with back pain or mobility issues, they can adjust their side to their comfort preference while you sleep soundly.\n\nOur adjustable beds include the correct  mattress for the base as standard. We know how important a purchase like a new bed is to you so we advise you to call us with any queries, no matter how small or if you can come to one of our stores.\n\nThe base (and matching headboard if required) are made to order in you choice from over 60 different fabrics &amp; colours.\n\n&nbsp;",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,"Beds > Adjustable Health Beds","Electric Bed, memory foam",,"https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Zero-Gravity-Electric-Bed.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/zero-gravity.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Eirini-Gkroridou-Tansun-Manufactured-in-UK-ident-300x300.png",,,,,,,,,0,Size,"2.6 Small Single, 3.0 Single, 4.0 Small Double, 4.6 Double, 5.0 Kingsize, 6.0 Super Kingsize",1,1,,"VAT Exempt","Not VAT Exempt, VAT Exempt",1,1,,,,,,

Manufactured by infusing a special layer of Coolgel&#x2122; to the base layer, it creates a sleeping surface which offers a latex-gel feel to provide sensational levels of comfort and rebound.\nThe advanced PU-based memory foam mattress has been engineered to offer the same feel and pressure relieving properties as a normal memory foam mattress but without the associated heat discomfort.\n\nThe mattress acclimates to cooler environments for softer, fresher, supported, blissful sleep. By using Coolgel&#x2122;, it provides a far better sleeping experience as it will feel cooler, softer and fresher.\n\nAdditional benefits also include being great for allergy and asthma suffers and offers a reliable long-lasting performance compared to normal memory foam products.\n\nThe Arizona Gel 5000 Mattress with a layer of CoolGel­&#x2122; Developed by NASA, memory foam is a unique layer of high density visco-elastic polymer gel which is heat and pressure sensitive.By using a layer of Coolgel&#x2122; to infuse into the mattress, it provides a far better sleeping experience as it will feel cooler, softer and fresher.\n\nBelow the layer of Coolgel&#x2122; our manufacturer uses A thick layer of reflex foam to act as the support mechanism/foundation layer in this mattress. Unlike memory foam, reflex foam does not mould to your body and bounces back very quickly. Due to these special properties, it is a fairly firm material which will provide a supportive layer to a mattress to ensure your weight is distributed properly. Married with 5000 pocket springs this really is an amazingly supportive and comfortable nights sleep.\n\nBritish made with a reinforced foam encapsulated border to offer edge to edge support.\n\n<hr />\n\n<ul>\n 	<li>Mattress Height       12″ / 30cm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[ux_video url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KhThvDKrmU""]",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,Mattresses,"2.6, 4ft, 6ft, BED, DOUBLE, KING, KINGSIZE, MATTRESS, ORTHOPAEDIC, SINGLE, Small Double, SMALL SINGLE, superking, superking ZIP, ZIP, ZIP AND LINK",,"https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Arizona.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cool-Action™-Gel-Memory-Foam.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,Size,"2.6 Small Single, 3.0 Single, 4.0 Small Double, 4.6 Double, 5.0 Kingsize, 6.0 Super Kingsize, 6.0 Zip &amp; Link Super King",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,

The Latex 1800 Mattress uses up to 1800 individual pocket springs which each work independently to fully support your body and they help to defer the transfer of movement. Reflex foam encapsulates the springs to add a further level of support. The mattress is then topped off with a generous layer of Talalay&#x2122; latex which is a great alternative to memory foam as latex doesn’t retain the heat like memory foam so gives a much cooler and more comfortable sleep. These three layers combined provide firm edge to edge support. The mattress is covered in an anti-bacterial Airtex&#x2122; stretch cover.\n\nThe Latex 1000 Mattress is of a medium to firm rating. This would make an ideal choice of mattress for those who prefer the additional support that a firmer mattress can offer without featuring any rigidity.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=""attribute_specs"" class=""inner"">\n<ul>\n 	<li>Mattress Type Pocket Sprung &amp; Latex Foam &amp; Reflex Foam Mattress</li>\n 	<li>Spring Count 1800</li>\n 	<li>Memory Foam Ratio 25mm Memory Foam, 25mm Latex Foam</li>\n 	<li>Mattress Height     12″ / 30cm</li>\n 	<li>Firmness Medium/Firm</li>\n 	<li>Mattress Cover/Finish Stretch Cover</li>\n 	<li>Hypoallergenic Yes</li>\n 	<li>Removable Cover Yes</li>\n 	<li>Guarantee 5 Years</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n[ux_video url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cSaWrctG-0""]",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,Mattresses,"2.6, 4ft, 6ft, BED, DOUBLE, KING, KINGSIZE, MATTRESS, ORTHOPAEDIC, SINGLE, Small Double, SMALL SINGLE, superking, superking ZIP, ZIP, ZIP AND LINK",,"https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Latex.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/image01.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/latex-mat.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/latex-matt.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,Size,"2.6 Small Single, 3.0 Single, 4.0 Small Double, 4.6 Double, 5.0 Kingsize, 6.0 Super Kingsize, 6.0 Zip &amp; Link Super King",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,

The Latex 1800 Mattress uses up to 1800 individual pocket springs which each work independently to fully support your body and they help to defer the transfer of movement. Reflex foam encapsulates the springs to add a further level of support. The mattress is then topped off with a generous layer of Talalay&#x2122; latex which is a great alternative to memory foam as latex doesn’t retain the heat like memory foam so gives a much cooler and more comfortable sleep. These three layers combined provide firm edge to edge support. The mattress is covered in an anti-bacterial Airtex&#x2122; stretch cover.\n\nThe Latex 1800 Mattress is of a medium to firm rating. This would make an ideal choice of mattress for those who prefer the additional support that a firmer mattress can offer without featuring any rigidity.\n\n<hr />\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=""attribute_specs"" class=""inner"">\n<ul>\n 	<li>Mattress Type Pocket Sprung &amp; Latex Foam &amp; Reflex Foam Mattress</li>\n 	<li>Spring Count 1800</li>\n 	<li>Memory Foam Ratio 25mm Memory Foam, 25mm Latex Foam</li>\n 	<li>Mattress Height     12"" / 30cm</li>\n 	<li>Total Height     28"" / 71cm</li>\n 	<li>Firmness Medium/Firm</li>\n 	<li>Mattress Cover/Finish Stretch Cover</li>\n 	<li>Hypoallergenic Yes</li>\n 	<li>Removable Cover Yes</li>\n</ul>\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cSaWrctG-0[/embed]\n\n<strong>Base Colour Options</strong>\n\nThese are just some of the fabric options for the base &amp; headboard, see in store for the full range.\n\n[gallery columns=""5"" ids=""10796,10795,10794,10793,10792,10791,10790,10789,10788,10787,10786,10785,10784,10783,10782,10781,10780,10779,10778,10777,10776,10775,10774,10773,10772""]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n</div>",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,"Beds > Divans","2.6, 4ft, 6ft, BED, divan, DOUBLE, KING, KINGSIZE, ORTHOPAEDIC, pocket sprung, SINGLE, Small Double, SMALL SINGLE, superking, superking ZIP, ZIP, ZIP AND LINK",,"https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Latex.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/latex-matt.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/latex-mat.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/image01.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,Size,"2.6 Small Single, 3.0 Single, 4.0 Small Double, 4.6 Double, 5.0 Kingsize, 6.0 Super Kingsize, 6.0 Zip &amp; Link Super King",1,1,,"Drawer Options","2 Drawers, 4 Drawers, No Drawers, Slidestore, Slidestore (Special Order)",1,1,"Base Colour","Over 40 colours to choose from",1,1,"No Drawers",

Cashmere is historically regarded as the softest natural hair.</li>\n 	<li>Wool &amp; Lamb’s Wool Layer - Lamb’s wool is used in this mattress as a soft and insulating upholstery layer for added comfort. Wool is a natural insulator providing coolness in the summer and warmth in the winter. Offering superb comfort, it also has hydroscopic properties encouraging the evaporation of body moisture.</li>\n 	<li>White Fibre Layer - A dust free white fibre filling is added to the mattress to provide softness and resilience. White fibre is formed into a deep layer for guaranteed quality and softness.</li>\n 	<li>Cotton Layer - A cotton layer with responsive properties that complement the spring unit is added to the mattress to help provide a comfortable feel.</li>\n 	<li>3 Rows of Silmulated Hand Side Stitching - Traditional hand-side stitching which secures the outer springs to the border at the top and bottom preventing roll-out and is the most highly skilled and labour intensive of all the operations. Side-stitching is carried out by senior upholsterers using traditional long needles and twine to make borders and edges stronger. The effects on the mattress are quite dramatic preventing the springs from distorting and extending the sleeping area right up to the edge of the bed to make the borders and edges stronger.</li>\n 	<li>Hand-Tufted - The traditional method of mattress upholstery where the fillings are secured by hand with tufts from the top of the mattress to the bottom to ensure all loose fillings are secured to provide the perfect finish</li>\n 	<li>Flag-stitched Handles - Handles on both sides for ease of positioning.</li>\n 	<li>Easy Care - No need to turn, but regular rotation from head to toe will extend the mattresses life span.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Measurements:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Mattress Depth - 38cm</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Guarantee</strong>\n\nThis product comes with a 5 year guarantee for your peace of mind.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n[ux_video url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFljayPAKFE""]",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,Mattresses,"2.6, 4ft, 6ft, BED, DOUBLE, KING, KINGSIZE, MATTRESS, ORTHOPAEDIC, SINGLE, Small Double, SMALL SINGLE, superking, superking ZIP, ZIP, ZIP AND LINK",,"https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RPT-Sovereign-6000-456x300-1.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/duke_3000_mattress.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kensington-4000-exeter-960x720-1.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RPT-Emperor-4000-456x300-1.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RPT-Sovereign-6000-456x300-1.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-year-warranty.png",,,,,,,,,0,Size,"2.6 Small Single, 3.0 Single, 4.0 Small Double, 4.6 Double, 5.0 Kingsize, 6.0 Super Kingsize, 6.0 Zip &amp; Link Super King",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,

The mattress combines the finest natural fillings, including natural cotton, lambswool, cashmere wool with the superior support of pocket springs, giving you the best sleep you deserve night after night.\n\nMattress Tension: <strong>Medium</strong>\n\n<strong>Features and Benefits:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>5000 Pocket Springs – The pocket spring system is the best at providing individual support to the sleeper.  The upper part of the spring shapes to the body contours whilst the lower part absorbs changes in weight distribution for the ultimate in comfort and support.  As a rule of thumb the higher the number of individual springs, the more support will be provided to the sleeper.  The springs work independently to avoid roll together.</li>\n 	<li>Cashmere Layer – A layer of cashmere is added to the mattress to provide levels of exquisite comfort. Cashmere is historically regarded as the softest natural hair.</li>\n 	<li>Wool &amp; Lamb’s Wool Layer – Lamb’s wool is used in this mattress as a soft and insulating upholstery layer for added comfort. Wool is a natural insulator providing coolness in the summer and warmth in the winter. Offering superb comfort, it also has hydroscopic properties encouraging the evaporation of body moisture.</li>\n 	<li>White Fibre Layer – A dust free white fibre filling is added to the mattress to provide softness and resilience. White fibre is formed into a deep layer for guaranteed quality and softness.</li>\n 	<li>Cotton Layer – A cotton layer with responsive properties that complement the spring unit is added to the mattress to help provide a comfortable feel.</li>\n 	<li>3 Rows of Traditional Hand Side Stitching – Traditional hand-side stitching which secures the outer springs to the border at the top and bottom preventing roll-out and is the most highly skilled and labour intensive of all the operations. Side-stitching is carried out by senior upholsterers using traditional long needles and twine to make borders and edges stronger. The effects on the mattress are quite dramatic preventing the springs from distorting and extending the sleeping area right up to the edge of the bed to make the borders and edges stronger.</li>\n 	<li>Hand-Tufted – The traditional method of mattress upholstery where the fillings are secured by hand with tufts from the top of the mattress to the bottom to ensure all loose fillings are secured to provide the perfect finish</li>\n 	<li>Flag-stitched Handles – Handles on both sides for ease of positioning.</li>\n 	<li>Fully turnable – Regular turning of the mattress, both from head to toe rotation &amp; turning over, will extend the mattresses life span.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Measurements:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Mattress Depth – 30cm</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Guarantee</strong>\n\nThis product comes with a 5 year guarantee for peace of mind.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,Mattresses,"2.6, 4ft, 6ft, BED, DOUBLE, KING, KINGSIZE, LINK, MATTRESS, ORTHOPAEDIC, SINGLE, Small Double, SMALL SINGLE, superking, ZIP, ZIP AND LINK",,"https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/file.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ddb3372c7185484818d482ca94dcff84-scaled.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/deluxe-beds-nicole-mattress.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/file.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mattress-Spring-Hand-Stitching-2-700x467-1.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Natural-Alpaca.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pocket-spring-mattress-hand-stitching-700x467-1.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C9B8869B-DA20-45F6-BE25-872E5F372659_750x556.jpeg",,,,,,,,,0,Size,"2.6 Small Single, 3.0 Single, 4.0 Small Double, 4.6 Double, 5.0 Kingsize, 6.0 Super Kingsize, 6.0 Zip &amp; Link Super King",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,

Luxuriously comfortable and truly convenient to use, the Parker Riser Recliner Chair is a fabric-upholstered model that you'll look forward to settling down in.\n\nYou spend hours in your chair through both good and bad days, so it's important that your chair offers comfort, support and total relaxation. With generous width (50cm) and depth (55cm) in the seat, this beautifully designed and comfortable piece of furniture will soon become your go-to chair. A sumptuous fabric finish guarantees a comfortable seating experience, and with soft yet durable upholstery, this chair will look great in any living space.\n\nWith a deep padded backrest design as a nod towards traditional riser recliners, the strong and sturdy construction will safely accommodate user weights up to 125kg (20 stone), while the big-button controller lets you find your favourite seating setup from the comfort of the chair, even if your sight isn't what it used to be.\n\nThe inclusion of a dual motor means you can easily find your favourite seating position, giving you the ability to independently adjust the footrest and the backrest. Such a level of customisable comfort means you will always find your favourite position for watching TV, reading, or catching up on sleep.\n\nThe Parkers gentle riser function will boost your independence, lifting you safely and gently out of the seat. The simple controller is designed to operate even at the slightest touch, helping you to stand and sit without assistance.\n\nLeave the chair raised for a simple return to comfortable seating by lowering yourself without excess strain on your arms and wrists.\n\n<img class="" wp-image-10976 aligncenter"" src=""https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Parker-Fabric-Story-722x400.jpg"" alt="""" width=""801"" height=""444"" />",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,,"Sofas &amp; Suites > Rise &amp; Recliner Chairs","Armchair, recliner, Rise &amp; Recliner Chair",,"https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/parker.jpg, https://kentbedsandsofas.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Parker-Grey-Fabric.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,"VAT Exempt","Not VAT Exempt, VAT Exempt",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,
